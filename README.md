# E-commerce-analysis

In this B2C e-commerce project, an analysis was conducted on a dataset of 500,000 e-commerce transactions to optimize operations and enhance customer loyalty. Leveraging Hadoop and Spark technologies, the dataset was processed efficiently to handle its size and complexity. 

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), key insights were uncovered, including the dominance of UK customers and seasonal transaction variations. Feature engineering led to the creation of variables such as RFM and others based on these findings. Logistic Regression was utilized to predict customer loyalty, with 'loyal_customer' as the target variable. 

The model was refined iteratively, incorporating additional predictors and optimizing hyperparameters using Spark's distributed computing capabilities. K-means Clustering facilitated customer profiling, providing guidance for personalized marketing strategies across different segments. 

Ultimately, the analysis underscored the significance of data-driven approaches in fostering customer relationships and driving revenue growth in e-commerce, empowered by the scalable processing power of Hadoop and Spark.
